Adaptive Enhancement and Plate-Aware OCR Selection for Robust License Plate Recognition in Hazy Conditions

This repository provides the official implementation of the method proposed in the paper:

Adaptive Enhancement and Plate-Aware OCR Selection for Robust License Plate Recognition in Hazy Conditions

The code is released to support reproducibility, transparency, and further research in Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) under adverse visual conditions.

📌 Overview

Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems often suffer performance degradation under hazy conditions due to low contrast, blur, and reduced visibility. To address this challenge, this work proposes an adaptive, OCR-oriented pipeline that avoids fixed preprocessing and instead selects the most plausible OCR output based on plate structure and confidence.

The proposed pipeline consists of:

Global dehazing using Dark Channel Prior (DCP) (dataset-level)

License plate detection and cropping using YOLOv11

Adaptive lightweight enhancement on cropped plate regions

Multi-branch OCR using PaddleOCR

Plate-aware scoring and selection to obtain the final plate output

└───────────────┴────────────────────┴───────────────┐ Plate-aware Scoring & Selection (structure, ambiguity, confidence) | Final Plate Output

🔧 Adaptive Enhancement Variants

Instead of enforcing a single preprocessing strategy, the system generates three lightweight enhancement variants for each cropped plate image:

RAW Original cropped plate image without additional enhancement.

CLAHE-light Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization with conservative parameters to improve local contrast without distorting character shapes.

SR2× + CLAHE-light Lightweight 2× upscaling (bicubic interpolation) followed by CLAHE-light, designed for small or low-resolution plates.

Each variant is processed independently by PaddleOCR.

🔍 Plate-Aware OCR Selection

For each license plate, multiple OCR candidates are generated. The final output is selected using a plate-aware scoring mechanism based on:

Structural validity of license plate format

Character ambiguity resolution (e.g., O–0, I–1, B–8)

OCR confidence score

This adaptive selection strategy improves end-to-end recognition accuracy without aggressive visual enhancement.

📊 Experimental Results (Summary)

The proposed adaptive method achieves:

100% readability rate

92.67% end-to-end exact accuracy

98.45% average character accuracy

These results outperform fixed preprocessing baselines such as direct crop OCR and super-resolution-only pipelines under hazy conditions.
